# Software Design Principles

## KISS

“Keep It Simple, Stupid” – The KISS programming, in particular, is really important. Try to keep this in your mind in your endeavors. The simpler your code is, the simpler it will be to maintain it in the future. This will be greatly appreciated by anyone else that needs to examine your code in the future.

## YAGNI

“You Aren’t Gonna Need It” – Sometimes, as developers, we try to think way ahead, into the future of the project, coding some extra features “just in case we need them” or thinking“we will eventually need them”. Just one word: Wrong! You didn’t need it, you don’t need it and in most of the cases… “You Aren’t Gonna Need It”.

## DRY

“Don’t Repeat Yourself” – How many times do you see that there are similar codes in different parts of a system? The DRY principle, formulated by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer, states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." In other words, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code.

## SOLID

In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

### Single responsibility principle

A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

### Open–closed principle

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

### Liskov substitution principle

"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

### Interface segregation principle

"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

### Dependency inversion principle

One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

## List of Development Philosophies

This is a list of approaches, styles, and philosophies in software development. It contains also software development processes, software development methodologies and single practices, principles and laws.
