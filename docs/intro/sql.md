## Summary

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in
programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data
where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data. SQL
offers two main advantages over older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM. First,
it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and
second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or
without an index.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL
consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as
sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition
language (DDL),a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation
language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation
(insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification),
and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great
extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
