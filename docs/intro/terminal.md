## Summary

A command line interface (CLI) is a type of human-computer interface (i.e., a way for humans to interact with computers) that relies solely on textual input and output. That is, the entire display screen, or the currently active portion of it, shows only characters (and no images), and input is usually performed entirely with a keyboard.

Understanding of basic CLI command is an important skill for all developers as they have to face linux server configurations. E.g. Developer requires the ability to access server through ssh protocol manipiulate folder structures and services remotely.
