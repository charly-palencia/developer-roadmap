## Summary

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

## Getting Started

### Base commands

As a developer, there are certain commands that we use very often during our daily process. A way to improve your skill is learning those commands as soon as you have the opportunity. Here's the basic [command list](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git).

### Advance commands
